Identity Server 8.0.4 is a security release that addresses hundreds of security vulnerabilities in the IdentityServer code base. We recommend that you update to this version.

- Fix over 100+ security vulnerabilities in the IdentityServer code base:
 - #17 Unsafe expansion of self-closing HTML tag
 - #18 URL redirection from remote source
 - #19 DOM text reinterpreted as HTML
 - #20 Incomplete string escaping or encoding
 - #21 Inefficient regular expression bug dependencies
 - #22 Bad HTML filtering regexp bug dependencies
 - #23 User-controlled bypass of sensitive method bug
 - #24 Unsafe jQuery plugins bug dependencies

Additional the codebase has been refactored to use the latest DotNet 8 features and best practices. 

This includes refactroing in #25 and consolidation of reused code that remove some nearly 1 million lines of code from the base.:
- Convert Top Level usings
- Convert Implicit usings.
- Samples use shared API and MVC projects to reduce code duplication and need to maintain dozens of copies of the same code.

## [8.0.3] - 2024-02-12

- Security Updates: Addtional priority critical security patches addressing issues outline in #9 and #10.
 - [Security: User-controlled bypass of sensitive method] - Login Controller and view have have explicit methods to handle login and cancel to address User-controlled bypass of sensitive method
 - [Security: Logging of user-controlled data] - Unsanitized user input could be used to forge logs and inject arbitrary commands, including server side includes, xss and sql injection into log files.
- [Maitenance]: Removed over half a million lines of code from the orginal Identity Server 4 code base using packages and libaries.
 - This will allow for easier maintenance and updates to the code base.
 - Developrs can now focus on the core functionality of Identity Server 8 and use LibMan to manage client side packages and keep packages up to date.
- Documentation Website: identityserver.readthedocs.io has been created and is now the official documentation website for IdentityServer
- Gitter: A Gitter chat room has been created for IdentityServer. You can join the chat at https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#identityserver:gitter.im
- Framework Upgrade: Upgrade Samples, including Clients, Quickstarts, and Key Management, to use DotNet 8 sdk style.
- [Quickstarts] (https://github.com/mvput/IdentityServer/tree/master/samples/Quickstarts) - Updated Quickstart samples to use Dotnet 8 startup with implicit usings and minimal Api.
- [Clients] (https://github.com/mvput/IdentityServer/tree/master/samples/Clients) - Updated client samples to use Dotnet 8 startup with implicit usings and minimal Api.
- [Key Management] (https://github.com/mvput/IdentityServer/tree/master/samples/KeyManagement) - Updated Key management samples to use Dotnet 8 startup with implicit usings and minimal Api. Changed default Entity Framework storage to file system storage as original Key Management is a paid solution. Roadmap: Add DbContext implementation fof key management.
- Client Side Packages: Client Side packages have now been ignored in source and are now installed using LibMan during the build process. This will allow for easier updates and management of client side packages.
